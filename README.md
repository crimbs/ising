In his 1924 PhD thesis, Ising erroneously predicted – based on his
investigation into the one-dimensional model – that there were no phase
transitions for any lattice dimension *d* with temperature *T* \> 0.
However, it has since been shown that abrupt phase transitions occur for
lattices with dimensions *d* ≥ 2. In 1944, Lars Onsager published his
proof for the two-dimensional Ising model, containing his analytical
result for the critical temperature for an infinite lattice
$$\\frac{k\_{B} T\_{c}}{J} = \\frac{2}{\\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})} = 2.269185\\ldots$$
